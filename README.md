# KirilRevived
NOTE:
THE BOT WILL NOT RUN UNLESS LAVALINK.JAR HAS BEEN PROPERLY SETUP

NOTE2: 

As of the latest victoria and discord API update the bot has been inconsistent.

#FIXED
The bot now receives string messages from bot channel, instead of receiving null strings.
Playing songs now works on occasion 

#TODO
More reliability fixes 
Reduce dependency injection (causes chaos when something breaks)
Maybe move on from lavalink since lavalink may cause reliability issues.
