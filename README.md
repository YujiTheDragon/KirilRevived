# KirilRevived
NOTE:

THE BOT WILL NOT RUN UNLESS LAVALINK.JAR HAS BEEN PROPERLY SETUP

THE BOT WAS MADE USING A TUTORIAL ON BOT CREATION (now it doesn't work because of API updates) AND PATCHED AND FIXED BY ME (this was hell I spent too much time on this) 

NOTE2: 

As of the latest victoria and discord API update the bot has been inconsistent.

#FIXED
The bot now receives string messages from bot channel, instead of receiving null strings.

Playing songs now works on occasion .

#TODO
More reliability fixes. 

Reduce dependency injection (causes chaos when something breaks).

Maybe move on from lavalink since lavalink may cause reliability issues.
